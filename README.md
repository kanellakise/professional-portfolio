# Professional Portfolio Project
## Weekly Project #2

This is the first version of my portfolio website. This site is built using HTML, and advanced CSS. Media queries have been utilized to adapt the content to a wide range of screen sizes.

 Clicking on a link in the header will navigate your screen to the section of the same name. 

Clicking on the text displayed over the images will load the corresponding website project. These links will be updated when a project is complete.

At the very bottom of the screen, you will find links to my personal GitHub page, email, and other social media pages.
